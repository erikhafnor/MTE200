| defib | ✅ | ✅ (initial) | Waveform parameter tolerances need exact spec citation |
| diathermy | ✅ | ✅ (initial) | Verify manufacturer tolerances for power accuracy |
| infusion | ✅ | ✅ (initial) | Verify occlusion level mapping (0–9 → mmHg) |

Conventions:
- English adaptations live in `extracted_en/` with same filename as Norwegian source.
- Each adaptation adds: Learning Objectives, Safety, Equipment, Background, Procedure, Measurements/Analysis (if relevant), Reflection, Common Pitfalls, Checklist.
- Original Norwegian remains authoritative for any regulatory/safety nuance until bilingual review complete.

Next steps:
1. Translate & adapt remaining six exercises.
2. Add citation/references section where appropriate.
3. Optional: Add version stamping inside each fragment.
